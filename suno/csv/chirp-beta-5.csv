In this life, it seems, you'll never be my stay.

Chorus
I can't hold you close, though I wish I could,
Our love's a tale misunderstood.
Through the endless years, I'll hold onto this truth,
In this lifetime, I can't have you.

Yet in the symphony of life's grand view,
Our love, immortal, will forever renew.
Though I can't possess, my heart still finds its way,
In this lifetime, forever, in my heart, you'll stay.",['blues']

In the silence of the night, I reach for you,
But you're an echo in the distance, never in view.

In their darkest hours, I feed on their fears.

Rhymes and beats, fueling our desire
We bring the rhythm, with the Middle Eastern groove
Unleashing magic, making heads move

We break barriers, watch our spirits unbound
Middle Eastern vibes, merging with rap's grace
Together we rise, breaking boundaries we embrace",['random']

Kate, oh Kate, you light up my days
With your smile that never fades away
Your kindness and grace, brighter than the sun
In my heart, you are the only one

Kate is the sweetest thing in my life
Her love makes everything feel right
With her by my side, I'll never fall
Kate, forever you have my all",['Phonk']
